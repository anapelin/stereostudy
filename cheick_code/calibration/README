Notice :
use : useCalibration.py

if you want to use function process call worldToImage.
if you want to use object process call useCalibration.

There are no big difference. 
You need to have parameters in a csv file in climavion folder.

the différence is the function process determine the model with size of parameters.
the process model you need to tell which model you want. 


Description :

Module calibration has differents files. 
2 ways  one with only function second with object model.

The 2 ways have 4 files.

baseCalibreation :
	16 functions
	basic function which you need with all model. (conversion normalisation read)
	1 objects définition.



useCalibration : 
	3 functions
	Function to use calibration model with function.

	Function to use calibration model with object.

	affichage des erreurs.


Function files :

calibrationFripon : 
	19 functions
	Function specific to fripon model. (model, cost function, normalisation, save)

calibrationM1 : 
	39 functions
	Function specific with the first model find. Sky camera geometric calibration using solar observations
	(model, function, cost function, normalisation, save)
	Documentation function not finish. (some function is unuse)

Object files:

OriginalModel :
	File contain OrigineMdodel, object with all method and attribue to use this model.

FriponModel :
	File contain FriponModel, object with all method and attribue to use this model.


If you want to make optimisation to find betters parameters use :

optimize_calibration.py  to use function process

optimize_calibration_withObject.py yo use model process

these files use dataset in /homedata/ngourgue/Images/2019 2019contrails_mix.csv, 2019sun_zoonFull.csv, 2019sun_zoonMean.csv (2019contrails_old.csv, 2019contrails_new, 2019sun.csv).

2019contrails_mix.csv is the concatenation with 2019contrails_new.csv and 2019contrails_old.csv. These are the with plane position and contrail line equation.
2019sun_zoonFull.csv : sun posiiton and annotation with zooniverse.
2019sun_zoonMean.csv : sun position and annotation with zooniverse meaning by image.
2019sun.csv : sun position and annotation with automatic algorithm.
